\title{Functions for calculating kinship matrices}
\usage{
astle(X, denominator = NULL)

GRM(X, denominator = NULL)

IBS(X, denominator = NULL)

vanRaden(X, denominator = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An n x m marker matrix with genotypes in the rows and markers in
the columns.}

\item{denominator}{A numerical value. See details.}
}
\value{
An n x n kinship matrix.
}
\description{
A collection of functions for calculating kinship matrices using different
algorithms. The following algorithms are included: astle (Astle and Balding,
2009), GRM, Identity By State (IBS) and VanRaden (VanRaden, 2008).
}
\details{
In all algorithms the input matrix \code{X} is first cleaned, i.e. markers
with a variance of 0 are excluded from the calculation of the kinship matrix.
Then some form of scaling is done which differs per algorithm. This gives a
scaled matrix \code{Z}. The matrix \eqn{ZZ^t / denominator} is returned.
By default the denominator is equal to the number of columns in \code{Z} for
\code{astle}, \code{GRM} and \code{IBS} and \eqn{2 * p * (1-p)} where
\eqn{p = colSums(X) / (2 * nrow(X))} for \code{vanRaden}. This denominator
can be overwritten by the user, e.g. when computing kinship matrices by
splitting \code{X} in smaller matrices and then adding the results together
in the end.

\examples{
X <- matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1), nrow = 3)
astle(X)
GRM(X)
IBS(X)
vanRaden(X)
